# LQR-LQG-control-with-State-space-model-for-the-active-control-of-cantilever-beam
Derived state-space model of a vibrating cantilever beam, deriving its first three frequencies for active vibration control.

Implemented a LQR control system in Simulink to actively suppress the first three vibration modes of a cantilever beam.

Interpreted open-loop and closed-loop beam responses and validated LQR controllerâ€™s vibration reduction effectiveness.
